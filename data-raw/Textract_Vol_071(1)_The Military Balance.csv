There are tables which give comparative figures for the last 20 years for the armed forces, defence expenditure and Gross National Product of major countries. The characteristics of the world's tanks are set out. Included as part of the European balance is a comparison of the new ship deliveries to the NATO and Warsaw Pact navies between 1961-70. There is a special section showing forces outside their parent country and the countries in which they are stationed. Other new features are tables of short-range nuclear delivery vehicles and of arms produc- tion in countries with significant and growing, but not all-embracing, defence industries.","'11","'97.75390625","04597227108459805/layout.csv"

The principal object of that deterrence is the only other 'super-power', the Soviet Union, with China as a subsidiary object of potentially increasing importance. Conversely, although less explicitly, Soviet strategic nuclear forces appear to be designed primarily to deter an American strategic attack upon the Soviet Union. The strategic forces and weapons of both super-powers have capabilities which, at least in theory, go beyond reciprocal deterrence, to the point of offering some prospect of limiting the damage which either would suffer should a strategic nuclear war occur. They also provide means of deterring lesser nuclear powers. In terms of intentions, however, it seems that deterrence of each other represents the first priority for both countries.","'22","'97.99804688","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) have not yet produced any formal agreement, although the governments issued a statement on 20 May 1971 in which they spoke of working out an agreement during the remaining months of the year which would limit the deployment of anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems and which would also include 'certain measures' of limitation on offensive weapons. Meanwhile, the expansion or modernization of strategic nuclear forces has continued on both sides. The Soviet Union, having matched the American total of offensive strategic missiles, has continued to deploy addi- tional inter-continental, ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on land, to construct additional ballistic-missile submarines and to develop more effective weapons for its offensive forces. At the same time, the United States has embarked upon an extensive modernization of its strategic offensive weapons which, over the next four years, will add considerably to the number and effectiveness of the nuclear warheads which its own land-based and sea-based forces can deliver. Both countries have also pursued attempts to deploy an effective ABM system: the Soviet Union by improving the small system which it already has, the United States by starting deployment of the Safeguard system which was announced in 1969.","'23","'97.80273438","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

Soviet deployment has, however, slowed down considerably since the beginning of 1970 and may have reached, or be approaching, its planned level. A number of underground silos of a new type have been observed, but it is not clear whether these are intended to fire a new ICBM (of which no other evidence has been reported) or to provide added protection for missiles of existing types, and especially for the large SS-9 missile. If, as seems possible, the latter is the case, this improvement of the silo for the SS-9 system will match the testing of an SS-9 multiple warhead cluster, containing three re-entry vehicles, in which the Soviet Union has been actively engaged since 1968.","'24","'96.38671875","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

Meanwhile, the United States has begun to deploy the more advanced Poseidon SLBM, with at least 10 independently-targeted re-entry vehicles. The first submarine equipped with Poseidon became operational during early 1971; the completion of the planned programme for converting 31 boats would raise the total number of nuclear warheads deliverable by the American SLBM force from about 1,500 (capable of attacking 656 separate targets) to over 5,400 (capable of attacking some 5,000 separate targets). For the longer term, development work continues on an Undersea Long-Range Missile System (ULMS), which might replace the Poseidon submarines themselves at the end of the 1970s.","'28","'98.24218750","04597227108459807/layout.csv"
"76","'5","'Text 15","'In contrast with the quantitative reinforcement of their offensive missile forces, the Soviet Union and the United States have continued to allow their strategic bomber forces to dwindle. The number of American B-52 bombers in service has dropped to well below 500, while the Soviet force of Mya-4 Bison and Tu-20 Bear bombers is now estimated at 140 aircraft (with an additional 50 Bison tankers). On the American side, however, the effectiveness of the B-52 force is likely to be greatly increased by the introduction of the new Short-Range Attack Missile (SRAM), which has been ordered into production and which is expected to have an operational range of 60-75 miles. Each B-52 could carry up to 24 SRAM, while the proposed B-1 bomber, prototype development of which is under way, would, if produced, be able to carry some 32 SRAM when it became opera- tional in about 1978. The total number of nuclear weapons deliverable by the American strategic bomber force is thus likely to rise sharply during the next five years. The Soviet Union has shown no apparent interest in matching this particular effort. The prototype of a new variable-geometry ('swing-wing') bomber has been observed, but it is not clear that, even if produced, it would have an effective inter-continental capability, and there have been no reports of any attempt to develop air-to-surface missiles for it (or for existing Soviet bombers) of a type comparable to SRAM.","'29","'97.65625000","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

Both countries have continued to devote efforts to developing means of defence against ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union, which completed deployment around Moscow of 64 ABM launchers for its Galosh missile in 1970, has been testing an improved ABM missile and may be ready to begin its deployment. It does not appear, however, to have modified the basic orientation of its ABM system, whose missiles and radars are deployed in a manner which suggests a strong bias towards defence against an attack by American ICBM. The United States has begun work on three sites for its Safeguard ABM system, each containing long-range Spartan and short-range Sprint missiles for the protection of a part of the Minuteman force against ICBM or SLBM attack, the first of which could be opera- tional at the end of 1974. Funds have also been requested for a fourth site, either at an additional Minuteman field or at Washington, D.C., as well as for the continuation of development work on an alternative system, known as Hard Site,* for the more economical and less vulnerable defence of Minuteman. On both sides, however, continued deployment of ABM launchers now depends heavily upon the outcome of the SALT negotiations.","'30","'96.28906250","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

At the same time, withdrawals from Vietnam and South Korea and the re- deployment of units from Japan have marked the further contraction of American military deploy- ment in Asia. No parallel manpower reductions or deployment changes have been apparent in the Soviet case. As far as navies are concerned the American tendency to reduce the active ship strength, while improving its quality, has been generally followed by the Soviet Union. Both navies have reduced overall numbers while continuing with modernization (see p. 82 for some comparative figures of new construction).","'31","'95.01953125","04597227108459807/layout.csv"

(Albania denounced the Pact in September 1968.)

The Soviet Union con- cluded status-of-forces agreements with Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Hungary between December 1956 and May 1957 and with Czechoslovakia in October 1968; all these remain in effect except the one with Rumania which lapsed in June 1958 when Soviet troops left Rumania.

"292","'2","'Text 8","'The second body, the Joint High Command, is directed, according to the Treaty, 'to strengthen the defensive capability of the Warsaw Pact, to prepare military plans in case of war and to decide on the deployment of troops'. The Command consists of a Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), a Defence Committee, made up of the six Defence Ministers of the Pact, which acts as an advisory body, and a Military Council. This body, which is modelled on a similar organization in the Soviet Armed Forces, meets under the chairmanship of the C-in-C, and includes the Chief of Staff (C of S) and permanent military representatives from each of the allied armed forces. (It seems to be the main channel through which the Pact's orders are transmitted to its forces in peacetime, and through which the East European forces are able to put their point of view to the C-in-C.) The Pact also has a Military Staff, which has been enlarged by additional non-Soviet senior officers. The posts of C-in-C and C of S of the Joint High Command have, however, always been held by Soviet officers, and most of the key positions are still in Soviet hands. In the event of war, the forces of the other Pact members would be operationally subordinate to the Soviet High Command. The command of the air defence system covering the whole Warsaw Pact area is centralized in Moscow and directed by the C-in-C of the Soviet Air Defence Forces.","'19","'93.79882813","04597227108459808/layout.csv"

The MR are in turn divided into Military Districts (MD), with usually two or three Districts to a Region. It is believed that basically one Army is assigned to each MD giving a total of about 30 Armies. An Army generally consists of three infantry divisions, three artillery regiments and, in some cases, three armoured regiments. Of the five armoured divisions in the PLA, two or three are probably kept in the Peking and Shenyang Regions. The geographical distribution of the divisions (excluding artillery) is believed to be: North and northeast China (Shenyang and Peking MR): 33 divisions.

"2492","'2","'Text 7","'Any assessment of the military balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact involves comparison of the strengths of both men and equipment, consideration of qualitative characteristics such as geographical advantages, deployment, training and logistic support, and differences in doctrine and philosophy. These are the factors - and there are others as well, including notably the performance of weapons systems - that are at the heart of military security and will have to be taken into account by both sides when con- sidering Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR), so as not to be placed, as a result of changes, at a disadvantage. (Most of these factors are variables and may change over time but the geographical asymmetry is not: this point is critical to any negotiations.)","'14","'96.14257813","04597227108459813/layout.csv"
"2493","'2","'Text 8","'Military considerations are, however, only part of the problem; political questions are of first importance. These include the extent to which reductions should consist of stationed or indigenous forces and their equipment; the impact on confidence of the measures for verification and control of force reductions; and the effect on relationships within alliances of any agreements reached. While the appraisal which follows touches on many matters central to MBFR, drawing attention as it does to asymmetries which now exist, it is military only and thus one-dimensional. It should be regarded as primarily a quantitative guide since there are difficulties in giving values, in so short a space, to qualitative factors and deciding on their rele- vance. Furthermore the situation is not a static one: any single presentation must have inadequacies. The comparisons necessarily over-simplify what is by its nature a complex problem.","'15","'94.43359375","04597227108459813/layout.csv"

The Northern European Command covers not only Norway but also the Baltic area including Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein and the Baltic Approaches. It is not possible to make precise calculations as to the Soviet formations that would be committed to the Baltic area rather than towards the NATO Central European Command. In both land and air forces there is a considerable degree of flexibility to do either: for the Warsaw Pact this sector is a coherent front. For this reason, Northern and Central Europe are grouped together in the tables which follow and Southern Europe is shown separately. Such a grouping conceals, however, a marked imbalance in North Norway.","'17","'97.11914063","04597227108459813/layout.csv"

This wide disparity highlights the problem of the defence of North Norway against surprise attack. To meet this difficulty a system of self defence, based on a powerful Home Guard and rapid mobilization, has been designed, to take maximum advantage of the ruggedness of the country and the poor road and rail communications, but it is clear that defence against attack of any size depends on timely external assistance.","'26","'97.94921875","04597227108459813/layout.csv"

The second is that the whole of the Italian land forces, which are included in the table under Southern Europe, are stationed in Italy and thus are at some distance from the areas of potential confrontation.","'27","'97.99804688","04597227108459813/layout.csv"

This relative weakness in tanks reflects NATO's essentially defensive role and is offset to some extent by a superiority in ground anti-tank weapons. NATO probably also has more effective airborne anti-tank weapons, such as the missiles carried by fighter aircraft and helicopters. In conventional artillery both sides are about equal in strength: NATO is, though, likely to have superior fire-power because of the greater lethality of its ammunition and the logistic capability to sustain higher rates of fire. This capability stems from a significantly higher transport lift, about half as high again in a NATO division as compared with a Warsaw Pact one. NATO has, however, an inflexible logistic system, based almost entirely on national supply lines with little central co-ordination. It cannot now use French territory and has many lines of communication running north to south, near the area of forward deployment.","'47","'97.65625000","04597227108459813/layout.csv"

NATO probably has some superiority in sophistication of equipment, the capability of its aircrews, which have in general higher training standards and fly more hours, and the versatility of its aircraft.
