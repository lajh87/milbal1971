<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-warsaw-pact"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> THE WARSAW PACT</h2>
<p>Treaties The Warsaw Pact is a multilateral military alliance formed by a ‘Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Co-operation’, which was signed in Warsaw on 14 May 1955 by the Governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Rumania. (Albania denounced the Pact in September 1968.) According to East European docu- mentary sources the Pact is committed to the defence of only the European territories of the member states. The Soviet Union is also linked by bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Rumania. All present members of the Warsaw Pact also have similar bilateral treaties with each other. The Soviet Union con- cluded status-of-forces agreements with Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Hungary between December 1956 and May 1957 and with Czechoslovakia in October 1968; all these remain in effect except the one with Rumania which lapsed in June 1958 when Soviet troops left Rumania. The essence of East European defence arrangements is not therefore dependent on the Warsaw Treaty as such.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="organization"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Organization</h3>
<p>The Organization of the Warsaw Pact has two main bodies. The first, the Political Consultative Committee, consists, in full session, of the First Secretaries of the Communist Party, Heads of Government and the Foreign and Defence Ministers of the member-countries. It met twice in the year up to July 1971, at which point there had been 17 meetings in all*. The Committee has a Joint Secretariat, headed by a Soviet officer, consisting of a specially appointed official from each country, and a Permanent Commission, whose task is to make recommendations on general questions of foreign policy for Pact members. Both these bodies are located in Moscow. The second body, the Joint High Command, is directed, according to the Treaty, ‘to strengthen the defensive capability of the Warsaw Pact, to prepare military plans in case of war and to decide on the deployment of troops’. The Command consists of a Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), a Defence Committee, made up of the six Defence Ministers of the Pact, which acts as an advisory body, and a Military Council. This body, which is modelled on a similar organization in the Soviet Armed Forces, meets under the chairmanship of the C-in-C, and includes the Chief of Staff (C of S) and permanent military representatives from each of the allied armed forces. (It seems to be the main channel through which the Pact’s orders are transmitted to its forces in peacetime, and through which the East European forces are able to put their point of view to the C-in-C.) The Pact also has a Military Staff, which has been enlarged by additional non-Soviet senior officers. The posts of C-in-C and C of S of the Joint High Command have, however, always been held by Soviet officers, and most of the key positions are still in Soviet hands. In the event of war, the forces of the other Pact members would be operationally subordinate to the Soviet High Command. The command of the air defence system covering the whole Warsaw Pact area is centralized in Moscow and directed by the C-in-C of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. The Soviet forces in the Warsaw Pact area are organized as the Northern Group of Forces, with headquarters at Legnica in Poland; the Southern Group of Forces, with headquarters at Budapest; Some of these meetings have been entitled Meetings of Ministers. 9 the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, with headquarters at Zossen-Wünsdorf, near Berlin; and the Central Group of Forces, consisting of five divisions in Czechoslovakia, with headquarters at Milovice, north of Prague. Soviet tactical air forces are stationed in Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union has deployed tactical nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe. Most East European countries have displayed short-range SSM launchers, but there is no evidence that nuclear warheads for these missiles have been supplied to these countries. Soviet MRBM (and other strategic weapons) are based in the Soviet Union and remain under Soviet control.</p>

<p>The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 by Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the United States; Greece and Turkey joined in 1952 and West Germany in 1955. The Treaty unites Western Europe and North America in a commitment to consult together if the security of any one member is threatened, and to consider an armed attack against one as an attack against all, to be met by such action as each of them deems necessary, ‘including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area’. 12 The Paris Agreements of 1954, added a Protocol to the Treaty, strengthening the structure of NATO, and revised the Brussels Treaty of 1948, which now includes Italy and West Germany in addition to its original members (Benelux countries, Britain and France). The Brussels Treaty signatories are committed to give one another ‘all the military and other aid and assistance in their power’ if they are the subject of ‘armed aggression in Europe’. Since 1969 members of the Atlantic Alliance can withdraw on one year’s notice; the Brussels Treaty was signed for 50 years.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="organization-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> Organization</h3>
<p>The Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty is known as NATO. The governing body of the alliance, the North Atlantic Council, which has its headquarters in Brussels, consists of the Ministers of the fifteen member-countries, who normally meet twice a year, and, in permanent session, of ambassadors representing each government. In 1966, France left the integrated military organization and the 14-nation Defence Planning Committee (DPC), on which France does not sit, was formed. It meets at the same levels as the Council and deals with questions related to NATO’s integrated military planning and other matters in which France does not participate. The Secretary-General and an international staff advise on the politico-military, financial, economic and scientific aspects of defence planning. Two permanent bodies for nuclear planning were established in 1966. The first, the Nuclear Defence Affairs Committee (NDAC) is open to all NATO members (France, Iceland and Luxem- bourg do not take part): it normally meets at Defence Minister level once or twice a year, to associate non-nuclear members in the nuclear affairs of the alliance. The Secretary-General is Chairman of the NDAC. The second, the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), derived from and subordinate to the NDAC, has eight members, and is intended to go further into the details of topics raised there. The members in June 1971 were Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the United States (Belgium, Denmark and Greece had participated earlier). The Secretary-General also chairs the NPG. The Council’s military advisors are the Military Committee, which gives policy direction to the NATO military commands. The Military Committee consists of the Chiefs of Staff of all member countries, except France, which maintains a liaison staff, and Iceland, which is not represented; in permanent session, the Chiefs of Staff are represented by Military Representatives who are located in Brussels together with the Council. The Military Committee has an independent Chair- man and is served by an integrated, international military staff. The major NATO Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee, although they also have direct access to the Council and heads of Governments. The principal military commands of NATO are Allied Command Europe (ACE), Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT) and Allied Command Channel (ACCHAN). The NATO European and Atlantic Commands participate in the Joint Strategic Planning System at Omaha, Nebraska, but there is no Alliance Command specifically covering strategic nuclear forces. As for ballistic-missile submarines, the United States has committed a small number and Britain all hers to the planning control of SACEUR, and the United States a larger number to SACLANT. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) have always been American officers; and the Commander-in-Chief Channel (CINCCHAN) and Deputy SACEUR and Deputy SACLANT British. SACEUR is also Com- mander-in-Chief of the United States forces in Europe. (i) ALLIED COMMAND EUROPE (ACE) has its headquarters known as SHAPE (Supreme Head- quarters, Allied Powers in Europe), at Casteau, near Mons, in Belgium. It is responsible for the 13 defence of all NATO territory in Europe excluding Britain, France, Iceland and Portugal and of all Turkey. It also has general responsibility for the air defence of Britain. The European Command has some 7,000 tactical nuclear warheads in its area. There is a very wide range in the kiloton spectrum. The number of delivery vehicles (aircraft, missiles and howitzers) is about 2,250, spread among all countries, excluding Luxembourg. The nuclear explosives them- selves, however, are maintained in American custody. Tactical nuclear bombs and missile war- heads are all fission. The average yield of the bombs stockpiled in Europe for the use of NATO tactical aircraft is about 100 kilotons, and of the missile warheads, 20 kilotons. About 60 division equivalents are available to SACEUR in peacetime. The Command has some 2,900 tactical aircraft, based on about 150 standard NATO airfields and backed up by a system of jointly financed storage depots, fuel pipelines and signal communications. The majority of the land and air forces stationed in the Command are assigned to SACEUR while the naval forces are earmarked. The 2nd French Corps of two divisions (which is not integrated in NATO forces) is stationed in Germany under a status agreement reached between the French and German Governments. Co- operation with NATO forces and commands has been agreed between the commanders concerned. The ACE Mobile Force (AMF), has been formed as a NATO force with particular reference to the northern or south-eastern flanks. Found by eight countries, it consists of eight infantry battalion groups, an armoured reconnaissance squadron and ground-support fighter squadrons, but has no air transport of its own. The following Commands are subordinate to Allied Command Europe:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT) has command of both the land forces and the air forces in the Central European Sector. Its headquarters are at Brunssum, Netherlands, and its Commander (CINCENT) is a German general. The forces of the Central European Command include 21 divisions assigned by Belgium, Britain, Canada, West Germany, the Netherlands and the United States and about 1,700 tactical aircraft. The Command is sub-divided into Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) and Central Army Group (CENTAG). NORTHAG, responsible for the defence of the sector north of the Göttingen- Liège axis, includes the Belgian, British and Dutch divisions, four German divisions and is supported by 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF), composed of Belgian, British, Dutch and German units. The American forces, seven German divisions and the Canadian battle group are under the Central Army Group, supported by the 4th ATAF which includes American, German and Canadian units, and an American Army Air Defense Command.</p></li>
<li><p>Allied Forces Northern Europe (AFNORTH) has its headquarters at Kolsaas, Norway, and is responsible for the defence of Denmark, Norway, Schleswig-Holstein and the Baltic Approaches. The Commander has always been a British General. Most of the Danish and Norwegian land, sea and tactical air forces are earmarked for it, and most of their active reserves assigned to it. Germany has assigned one division, two combat air wings and her Baltic fleet.</p></li>
<li><p>Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) has its headquarters at Naples, and its Commander (CINCSOUTH) has always been an American admiral. It is responsible for the defence of Italy, Greece and Turkey, and for safeguarding communications in the Mediterranean and the Turkish territorial waters of the Black Sea. The formations available include 14 divisions from Turkey, 12 from Greece and 7 from Italy, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries. Other formations from these three countries have been earmarked for AFSOUTH, as have the United States 6th Fleet, and naval forces of Greece, Italy, Turkey and Britain. The ground-defence system is based on two separate commands: Southern, comprising Italy and the approaches to it, under an Italian Commander, and South-Eastern, comprising Greece and Turkey, under an American Commander. There is, however, an overall air command and there is a single naval command (NAVSOUTH), responsible to AFSOUTH with its headquarters in Malta. 14 A special air surveillance unit, Maritime Air Forces Mediterranean (MARAIRMED), is now operating Italian, British and American patrol aircraft from bases in Greece, Turkey, Sicily, Malta and Italy. French aircraft are participating in these operations. Its Commander, an American rear admiral, is immediately responsible to CINCSOUTH. The Allied On-Call Naval Force for the Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED) has consisted of at least three destroyers, contributed by Italy, Britain and the United States, and three smaller ships provided by other Mediterranean countries, depending upon the area of operation.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>ALLIED COMMAND ATLANTIC (ACLANT) has its headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia, and is res- ponsible for the North Atlantic area from the North Pole to the Tropic of Cancer, including Portuguese coastal waters. In the event of war, its duties are to participate in the strategic strike and to protect sea com- munications. There are no forces assigned to the command in peacetime except Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), which normally consists, at any one time, of four destroyer- type ships. However, for training purposes and in the event of war, forces which are predominantly naval are earmarked for assignment by Britain, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Portugal and the United States. There are arrangements for co-operation between French naval forces and those of SACLANT. There are five subordinate commands: Western Atlantic Command, Eastern Atlantic Command, Iberian Atlantic Command, Striking Fleet Atlantic and Submarine Command. The nucleus of the Striking Fleet Atlantic has been provided by the American 2nd Fleet with up to six attack carriers; their nuclear role is shared with the missile-firing submarines.</p></li>
<li><p>ALLIED COMMAND CHANNEL (ACCHAN) has its headquarters at Northwood near London. The wartime role of Channel Command is to exercise control of the English Channel and the southern North Sea. Many of the smaller warships of Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands are earmarked for this Command, as are some maritime aircraft. There are arrangements for co-operation with French naval forces.</p></li>

<p>The political and strategic guidance laid down in 1967 includes the concept of political warning time in a crisis and the possibility of distinguishing between an enemy’s military capabilities and his political intentions. The strategic doctrine defined by the DPC in December 1967 envisaged that NATO would meet attacks on its territory with whatever force levels were appropriate. In June 1968 at the Ministerial Meeting at Reykjavik, the Council called on the countries of the Warsaw Pact to join in discussions of mutual force reductions, reciprocal and balanced in scope and timing, and repeated this invitation at their meeting in Rome in 1970.</p>
