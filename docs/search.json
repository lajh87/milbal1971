    "text": "1 PREFACE\nThe Military Balance introduces this year much new, material. There are tables which give comparative figures for the last 20 years for the armed forces, defence expenditure and Gross National Product of major countries. The characteristics of the world’s tanks are set out. Included as part of the European balance is a comparison of the new ship deliveries to the NATO and Warsaw Pact navies between 1961-70. There is a special section showing forces outside their parent country and the countries in which they are stationed. Other new features are tables of short-range nuclear delivery vehicles and of arms produc- tion in countries with significant and growing, but not all-embracing, defence industries. Certain items have been omitted, to save space or because last year’s entries remain essentially up to date. The Latin American countries are a case in point: they have been excluded this time but it is the intention to return to them next year. An index is included (see p. 83) to give guidance to features appearing in one or more, but not all, of the last four issues (including this one). The Institute assumes full responsibility for the facts and judgments which the document contains. The co-operation of governments has been sought and in many cases received. Not all countries have been equally co-operative in producing information and some figures have been estimated. The Institute owes a considerable debt to a number of its own members and consultants who have assisted in compiling and checking material. Manpower figures given are those of regular forces, although an indication of the size of para-military forces, militia or reserve forces has been given in the sections dealing with individual countries. Figures for defence expenditures are the latest available and are generally exclusive of military aid. A glossary of the abbreviations that have been used in the text will be found overleaf. On the facing page are notes explaining the bases for the conversion of national currency figures into dollars and giving the strengths of some military formations. This study examines the facts of military power as they existed in July 1971. No projections of force levels or weapons beyond 1971 have been included, except where explicitly stated. The material should not be regarded as a comprehensive guide to the balance of strategic power; in particular it does not reflect the facts of geography, vulnerability or efficiency, except where these are touched upon in the appendix on the NATO-Warsaw Pact balance. The Military Balance is complemented by another annual publication, Strategic Survey, published each spring, which reviews the most significant issues of international security and conflict in the previous calendar year and describes the major developments in strategic and defence policy and in weapons throughout the world.\nSeptember 1971"

For another, much discussed, view on this exchange rate see The Technological Base of Soviet Military Power, by Michael Boretsky, a Paper sub- mitted in September 1970 to the Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy of the US Congressional Joint Economic Committee. See Survival, October 1971. The official exchange rate is 0.9 roubles ICBM: about 1,510. 220 SS-7 and SS-8. 280 SS-9. 950 SS-11 (about 100 have been sited in IRBM/ MRBM fields and may have a variable range capability). 60 SS-13 (solid-fuelled). IRBM and MRBM: about 700. 100 SS-5 IRBM. 600 SS-4 MRBM.\n\nThe rouble figure represents the declared budget of the Ministry of Defence and does not include certain expenditures such as the cost of nuclear warheads, research and development expenditure on advanced weapons systems, and the military elements of the space programme, which are believed to be included in the budget of other ministries. Total military ex- penditure could be of the order of $55 billion. § Characteristics of nuclear delivery vehicles are given in Table 1 on p. 55. II The Strategic Rocket Forces are a separate Service, with their own manpower. 6 (IRBMs and MRBMs are sited near the southern, eastern and western borders of the USSR: about 70 cover targets in China and Japan; and about 630 targets in Western Europe.)

Medium Bombers: 700. 500 Tu-16 Badger and 200 Tu-22 Blinder.\n\nDEFENSIVE Air Defence Command (PVO-Strany) is a separate command of anti-aircraft artillery and surface- to-air missile units, using an early-warning system based on radar, and fighter-interceptor squadrons for identification and interception; total strength 500,000 (250,000 from Army and 250,000 from Air Force). Aircraft: about 3,200. Interceptors: mostly MiG-19, MiG-21 and Su-9 with a few MiG-17 still in service. Newer aircraft include the Yak-28P and Tu-28, and more recently, the Su-11 and MiG-23. Many of these aircraft carry AAM.\n\n\n2.4.1 Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM)\nAEW aircraft: some modified Tu-114 with the designation Moss. About 75 per cent is based on European USSR, with most of the remainder in the Far East; in addition, it has staging and dispersal points in the Arctic. Galosh: 64 launchers for these multi-stage missiles are deployed around Moscow. They are believed to have a range of over 200 miles and to carry a nuclear warhead in the megaton range.\nSA-1: An early vintage AA missile. SA-2: about 8,000. A 2-stage boosted AA missile, slant range (from launch to contact with target) about 25 miles, effective between 3,000 and 80,000 ft. SA-3: A 2-stage missile, probably intended for short-range defence against low-flying aircraft, to supplement SA-2. It has a slant range of about 15 miles.\nSA-4: An air-transportable, mobile AA missile with solid-fuel boosters. They are twin mounted on tracked carriers and assigned to ground forces in the field.\nSAM SA-5: A 2-stage boosted missile developed in a long-range AA role.\nSA-6: A triple-mounted missile on a tracked vehicle. It is entering service as a defence against low-flying aircraft to supplement SA-4 in the field forces.\n\n\n2.4.2 Army: 2,000,000 (including elements in the Air Defence Command).\n102 motorized rifle divisions. 51 tank divisions. 7 airborne divisions. Tactical nuclear missile units are organic to forma- tions. T-10 hy tanks; T-62 and T-54/-55 med tanks; PT-76 amphibious recce It tanks (most Soviet tanks are equipped for amphibious crossing by deep wading, and many carry infra-red night- fighting equipment). At full strength, tank divisions have 325 medium tanks and motorized rifle divisions 175. SP assault guns (in AB divs only); 100mm, 122mm, 130mm, 152mm and 203mm guns; 57mm, 85mm, 100mm, 120mm and 130mm ATk guns; Scud Scaleboard FROG SSM, mounted on modified tank chassis and wheeled launchers; Shaddock cruise SSM; Snapper, Swatter and Sagger ATGW. The Soviet Army also has a considerable air defence capability, including SAM. Anti-Aircraft Artillery 14.5mm, 23mm, 57mm guns and ZSU-57-2 twin- barrelled and ZSU-23-4 four-barrelled SP guns on tank chassis. Central and Eastern Europe: 31 divs of which 20 divs (10 tank) are in East Germany; 2 tank divs in Poland; 4 divs (2 tank) in Hungary; and 5 divs in Czechoslovakia. Central USSR (between the Ural Mountains and Lake Baikal): 8 divs. Southern USSR (Caucasus and West Turkestan): 28 divs. Sino-Soviet border area: 33 divs (10 tank) incl 2 divs in Mongolia. The 31 divisions in Eastern Europe are maintained at or near combat-strength, as are about 15 of those in the Far East. The other divisions in the Far East are probably in the second category of readiness: below combat-strength, but not requiring major reinforcement in the event of war. Most of the remaining combat-ready divisions are in European USSR, while the divisions in central USSR would mostly require major reinforcement, as would 10 of the divisions in southern USSR.\n\n\n2.4.3 DEPLOYMENT:\nEuropean USSR: 60 divs. 7 Outside the Warsaw Pact area (mostly as instruc- tors and advisors). 1,000 in Cuba, 15-20,000 in Egypt, 1,000 in Sudan, 1,000 in Syria, 1,500 in Algeria and 1,000 in North Vietnam. Navy: 475,000 (incl Naval Air Force 75,000). Submarines (excluding ballistic-missile vessels): Attack: 25 nuclear-powered; 210 diesel-powered. Cruise-missile: 35 nuclear-powered and 25 diesel- powered (with 4-8 300-mile range msls).\n\n\n2.4.4 Surface ships\n2 ASW helicopter cruisers with SAM and up to 20 KA-25 helicopters. 2 Kresta II-class cruisers with (horizon-range) surface-to-surface cruise missiles (SSCM) and SAM. 4 Kresta I-class cruisers with SSCM and SAM. 4 Kynda-class cruisers with SSCM and SAM. 8 Sverdlov-class and 2 older cruisers (1 with SAM). 1 Krivak-class destroyer with SSCM and SAM. 6 Kanin-class destroyers with SAM. 3 Krupny-class destroyers with SSCM. 4 Kildin-class destroyers with SSCM. 17 Kashin-class destroyers with SAM. 9 modified Kotlin-class destroyers with SAM. 23 Kotlin-class destroyers. 40 Skory- and modified Skory-class destroyers. 105 other ocean-going escorts. 250 coastal escorts and submarine chasers. 110 Osa- and 30 Komar-class patrol boats with SSCM. 250 fast patrol boats. 180 fleet minesweepers. 125 coastal minesweepers. 105 landing ships and numerous landing craft. Some trawlers are used for electronic intelligence. All submarines and the larger surface vessels not fitted with SSM are equipped for minelaying. A proportion of the destroyers and smaller vessels may not be fully manned. Shore-based aircraft Bombers: 500, most based near the north-west and Black Sea coasts of the USSR. 300 Tu-16 with Kipper or Kelt ASM. 100 Tu-16 reconnaissance and tanker aircraft (replacement of the reconnaissance version with the Tu-22 Blinder has begun). 50 II-28 torpedo-equipped light bombers. 50 Tu-20 long-range naval reconnaissance. Other aircraft and helicopters - 500. 75 Be-12 ASW amphibians. 25 Il-18 May ASW aircraft. 200 Mi-4 and Ka-25 ASW helicopters. 200 miscellaneous transports. Naval Infantry - about 15,000. DEPLOYMENT: Arctic, Baltic, Black Sea and Far East Fleets.\n\n\n2.4.5 Air Force: 550,000: 10,000 combat aircraft.\n\nThe Long Range Air Force (see p. 6).\nTactical Air Force: altogether about 5,000 aircraft, incl light bombers, fighters, helicopters, transport and reconnaissance aircraft. Some obsolescent MiG-17, MiG-19 and Il-28 are still in service. The most notable high performance aircraft are the MiG-21J and Yak-28P Firebar fighters; the ground-attack Su-7; and the super- sonic light bomber Yak-28. Ground-attack air- craft are equipped with a variety of air-to-ground rockets. The variable-geometry Flogger may be about to enter service.\nAir Defence Command (see p. 6), and (iv) Naval Air Force (see above).\nAir Transport Force - about 1,700 aircraft. Il-14, An-24, some 800 An-12 and Il-18 medium transports and 10 An-22 heavy transports. There are in addition civil airliners of Aeroflot, some of which could be adapted to military use; these include about 275 long- and medium-range Tu-104, Tu-114, Tu-124 and Tu-134. About 800 helicopters in use with the ground forces including troop-carrying Mi-6 and Mi-8 and the heavy load-carrier Mi-10. The Mi-12, a very heavy load carrier, may soon enter service. The total helicopter inventory is probably around 1,750. Para-Military Forces: 300,000. 125,000 security troops; 175,000 border troops. There are also about 1.5 million members of the part-time military training organization (DOSAAF), who take part in such recreational activities as athletics, shooting and parachuting, but reservist training and refresher courses seem to be haphazard and irregular. However, DOSAAF assists in pre-military training being given in schools, colleges, and workers’ centres, to those of 16 years and over."

    "section": "3.1 THE WARSAW PACT",
    "text": "3.1 THE WARSAW PACT\nTreaties The Warsaw Pact is a multilateral military alliance formed by a ‘Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Co-operation’, which was signed in Warsaw on 14 May 1955 by the Governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Rumania. (Albania denounced the Pact in September 1968.) According to East European docu- mentary sources the Pact is committed to the defence of only the European territories of the member states. The Soviet Union is also linked by bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Rumania. All present members of the Warsaw Pact also have similar bilateral treaties with each other. The Soviet Union con- cluded status-of-forces agreements with Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Hungary between December 1956 and May 1957 and with Czechoslovakia in October 1968; all these remain in effect except the one with Rumania which lapsed in June 1958 when Soviet troops left Rumania. The essence of East European defence arrangements is not therefore dependent on the Warsaw Treaty as such.\n\n3.1.1 Organization\nThe Organization of the Warsaw Pact has two main bodies. The first, the Political Consultative Committee, consists, in full session, of the First Secretaries of the Communist Party, Heads of Government and the Foreign and Defence Ministers of the member-countries. It met twice in the year up to July 1971, at which point there had been 17 meetings in all*. The Committee has a Joint Secretariat, headed by a Soviet officer, consisting of a specially appointed official from each country, and a Permanent Commission, whose task is to make recommendations on general questions of foreign policy for Pact members. Both these bodies are located in Moscow. The second body, the Joint High Command, is directed, according to the Treaty, ‘to strengthen the defensive capability of the Warsaw Pact, to prepare military plans in case of war and to decide on the deployment of troops’. The Command consists of a Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), a Defence Committee, made up of the six Defence Ministers of the Pact, which acts as an advisory body, and a Military Council. This body, which is modelled on a similar organization in the Soviet Armed Forces, meets under the chairmanship of the C-in-C, and includes the Chief of Staff (C of S) and permanent military representatives from each of the allied armed forces. (It seems to be the main channel through which the Pact’s orders are transmitted to its forces in peacetime, and through which the East European forces are able to put their point of view to the C-in-C.) The Pact also has a Military Staff, which has been enlarged by additional non-Soviet senior officers. The posts of C-in-C and C of S of the Joint High Command have, however, always been held by Soviet officers, and most of the key positions are still in Soviet hands. In the event of war, the forces of the other Pact members would be operationally subordinate to the Soviet High Command. The command of the air defence system covering the whole Warsaw Pact area is centralized in Moscow and directed by the C-in-C of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. The Soviet forces in the Warsaw Pact area are organized as the Northern Group of Forces, with headquarters at Legnica in Poland; the Southern Group of Forces, with headquarters at Budapest; Some of these meetings have been entitled Meetings of Ministers. 9 the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, with headquarters at Zossen-Wünsdorf, near Berlin; and the Central Group of Forces, consisting of five divisions in Czechoslovakia, with headquarters at Milovice, north of Prague. Soviet tactical air forces are stationed in Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union has deployed tactical nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe. Most East European countries have displayed short-range SSM launchers, but there is no evidence that nuclear warheads for these missiles have been supplied to these countries. Soviet MRBM (and other strategic weapons) are based in the Soviet Union and remain under Soviet control."

    "section": "3.7 THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY",
    "text": "3.7 THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY\n\n3.7.1 Treaties\nThe North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 by Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the United States; Greece and Turkey joined in 1952 and West Germany in 1955. The Treaty unites Western Europe and North America in a commitment to consult together if the security of any one member is threatened, and to consider an armed attack against one as an attack against all, to be met by such action as each of them deems necessary, ‘including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area’. 12 The Paris Agreements of 1954, added a Protocol to the Treaty, strengthening the structure of NATO, and revised the Brussels Treaty of 1948, which now includes Italy and West Germany in addition to its original members (Benelux countries, Britain and France). The Brussels Treaty signatories are committed to give one another ‘all the military and other aid and assistance in their power’ if they are the subject of ‘armed aggression in Europe’. Since 1969 members of the Atlantic Alliance can withdraw on one year’s notice; the Brussels Treaty was signed for 50 years.\n\n\n3.7.2 Organization\nThe Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty is known as NATO. The governing body of the alliance, the North Atlantic Council, which has its headquarters in Brussels, consists of the Ministers of the fifteen member-countries, who normally meet twice a year, and, in permanent session, of ambassadors representing each government. In 1966, France left the integrated military organization and the 14-nation Defence Planning Committee (DPC), on which France does not sit, was formed. It meets at the same levels as the Council and deals with questions related to NATO’s integrated military planning and other matters in which France does not participate. The Secretary-General and an international staff advise on the politico-military, financial, economic and scientific aspects of defence planning. Two permanent bodies for nuclear planning were established in 1966. The first, the Nuclear Defence Affairs Committee (NDAC) is open to all NATO members (France, Iceland and Luxem- bourg do not take part): it normally meets at Defence Minister level once or twice a year, to associate non-nuclear members in the nuclear affairs of the alliance. The Secretary-General is Chairman of the NDAC. The second, the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), derived from and subordinate to the NDAC, has eight members, and is intended to go further into the details of topics raised there. The members in June 1971 were Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the United States (Belgium, Denmark and Greece had participated earlier). The Secretary-General also chairs the NPG. The Council’s military advisors are the Military Committee, which gives policy direction to the NATO military commands. The Military Committee consists of the Chiefs of Staff of all member countries, except France, which maintains a liaison staff, and Iceland, which is not represented; in permanent session, the Chiefs of Staff are represented by Military Representatives who are located in Brussels together with the Council. The Military Committee has an independent Chair- man and is served by an integrated, international military staff. The major NATO Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee, although they also have direct access to the Council and heads of Governments. The principal military commands of NATO are Allied Command Europe (ACE), Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT) and Allied Command Channel (ACCHAN). The NATO European and Atlantic Commands participate in the Joint Strategic Planning System at Omaha, Nebraska, but there is no Alliance Command specifically covering strategic nuclear forces. As for ballistic-missile submarines, the United States has committed a small number and Britain all hers to the planning control of SACEUR, and the United States a larger number to SACLANT. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) have always been American officers; and the Commander-in-Chief Channel (CINCCHAN) and Deputy SACEUR and Deputy SACLANT British. SACEUR is also Com- mander-in-Chief of the United States forces in Europe. (i) ALLIED COMMAND EUROPE (ACE) has its headquarters known as SHAPE (Supreme Head- quarters, Allied Powers in Europe), at Casteau, near Mons, in Belgium. It is responsible for the 13 defence of all NATO territory in Europe excluding Britain, France, Iceland and Portugal and of all Turkey. It also has general responsibility for the air defence of Britain. The European Command has some 7,000 tactical nuclear warheads in its area. There is a very wide range in the kiloton spectrum. The number of delivery vehicles (aircraft, missiles and howitzers) is about 2,250, spread among all countries, excluding Luxembourg. The nuclear explosives them- selves, however, are maintained in American custody. Tactical nuclear bombs and missile war- heads are all fission. The average yield of the bombs stockpiled in Europe for the use of NATO tactical aircraft is about 100 kilotons, and of the missile warheads, 20 kilotons. About 60 division equivalents are available to SACEUR in peacetime. The Command has some 2,900 tactical aircraft, based on about 150 standard NATO airfields and backed up by a system of jointly financed storage depots, fuel pipelines and signal communications. The majority of the land and air forces stationed in the Command are assigned to SACEUR while the naval forces are earmarked. The 2nd French Corps of two divisions (which is not integrated in NATO forces) is stationed in Germany under a status agreement reached between the French and German Governments. Co- operation with NATO forces and commands has been agreed between the commanders concerned. The ACE Mobile Force (AMF), has been formed as a NATO force with particular reference to the northern or south-eastern flanks. Found by eight countries, it consists of eight infantry battalion groups, an armoured reconnaissance squadron and ground-support fighter squadrons, but has no air transport of its own. The following Commands are subordinate to Allied Command Europe:\n\nAllied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT) has command of both the land forces and the air forces in the Central European Sector. Its headquarters are at Brunssum, Netherlands, and its Commander (CINCENT) is a German general. The forces of the Central European Command include 21 divisions assigned by Belgium, Britain, Canada, West Germany, the Netherlands and the United States and about 1,700 tactical aircraft. The Command is sub-divided into Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) and Central Army Group (CENTAG). NORTHAG, responsible for the defence of the sector north of the Göttingen- Liège axis, includes the Belgian, British and Dutch divisions, four German divisions and is supported by 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF), composed of Belgian, British, Dutch and German units. The American forces, seven German divisions and the Canadian battle group are under the Central Army Group, supported by the 4th ATAF which includes American, German and Canadian units, and an American Army Air Defense Command.\nAllied Forces Northern Europe (AFNORTH) has its headquarters at Kolsaas, Norway, and is responsible for the defence of Denmark, Norway, Schleswig-Holstein and the Baltic Approaches. The Commander has always been a British General. Most of the Danish and Norwegian land, sea and tactical air forces are earmarked for it, and most of their active reserves assigned to it. Germany has assigned one division, two combat air wings and her Baltic fleet.\nAllied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) has its headquarters at Naples, and its Commander (CINCSOUTH) has always been an American admiral. It is responsible for the defence of Italy, Greece and Turkey, and for safeguarding communications in the Mediterranean and the Turkish territorial waters of the Black Sea. The formations available include 14 divisions from Turkey, 12 from Greece and 7 from Italy, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries. Other formations from these three countries have been earmarked for AFSOUTH, as have the United States 6th Fleet, and naval forces of Greece, Italy, Turkey and Britain. The ground-defence system is based on two separate commands: Southern, comprising Italy and the approaches to it, under an Italian Commander, and South-Eastern, comprising Greece and Turkey, under an American Commander. There is, however, an overall air command and there is a single naval command (NAVSOUTH), responsible to AFSOUTH with its headquarters in Malta. 14 A special air surveillance unit, Maritime Air Forces Mediterranean (MARAIRMED), is now operating Italian, British and American patrol aircraft from bases in Greece, Turkey, Sicily, Malta and Italy. French aircraft are participating in these operations. Its Commander, an American rear admiral, is immediately responsible to CINCSOUTH. The Allied On-Call Naval Force for the Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED) has consisted of at least three destroyers, contributed by Italy, Britain and the United States, and three smaller ships provided by other Mediterranean countries, depending upon the area of operation.\n\n\nALLIED COMMAND ATLANTIC (ACLANT) has its headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia, and is res- ponsible for the North Atlantic area from the North Pole to the Tropic of Cancer, including Portuguese coastal waters. In the event of war, its duties are to participate in the strategic strike and to protect sea com- munications. There are no forces assigned to the command in peacetime except Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), which normally consists, at any one time, of four destroyer- type ships. However, for training purposes and in the event of war, forces which are predominantly naval are earmarked for assignment by Britain, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Portugal and the United States. There are arrangements for co-operation between French naval forces and those of SACLANT. There are five subordinate commands: Western Atlantic Command, Eastern Atlantic Command, Iberian Atlantic Command, Striking Fleet Atlantic and Submarine Command. The nucleus of the Striking Fleet Atlantic has been provided by the American 2nd Fleet with up to six attack carriers; their nuclear role is shared with the missile-firing submarines.\nALLIED COMMAND CHANNEL (ACCHAN) has its headquarters at Northwood near London. The wartime role of Channel Command is to exercise control of the English Channel and the southern North Sea. Many of the smaller warships of Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands are earmarked for this Command, as are some maritime aircraft. There are arrangements for co-operation with French naval forces.\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Policy\nThe political and strategic guidance laid down in 1967 includes the concept of political warning time in a crisis and the possibility of distinguishing between an enemy’s military capabilities and his political intentions. The strategic doctrine defined by the DPC in December 1967 envisaged that NATO would meet attacks on its territory with whatever force levels were appropriate. In June 1968 at the Ministerial Meeting at Reykjavik, the Council called on the countries of the Warsaw Pact to join in discussions of mutual force reductions, reciprocal and balanced in scope and timing, and repeated this invitation at their meeting in Rome in 1970."

The United States has varying types of security assistance agreements and provides significant military aid on either a grant or credit basis to Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. It provides, in addition, a significant amount of military equip- ment on a cash sales basis to many countries, notably Israel, Spain and Jordan. For grant military assistance purposes Greece and Turkey are considered forward defence areas and Spain is considered a base rights country. Communication bases are maintained in Morocco under informal arrange- ments. The Soviet Union has a military assistance agreement, concluded in December 1970, and a 15 year treaty of friendship and co-operation, signed in May 1971, with the UAR. Important military assistance is also provided to Algeria, Iraq, Sudan and Syria which may be covered by more informal arrangements. The People’s Republic of China has supplied arms to Albania, and has a treaty of friendship with the Yemen. Britain has defence commitments to Cyprus, Gibraltar, and Malta,* and has proposed defence arrangements with the lower Gulf States after her withdrawal from the Persian Gulf at the end of 1971. Britain is also an important arms supplier for the Gulf Sheikhdoms, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. France has a pilot training agreement with Morocco but no other formal commitments in the region. The facilities provisions of the Evian agreements with Algeria lapsed at the end of 1970 with the return of the Bou-Sfer airbase to Algeria. France sells arms to a number of countries, notably to Libya."

The loosely associated Eastern Front Command, comprising Iraq, Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Army and Syria, was reorganized in December 1970 into separate Jordanian and Syrian commands. Iraq and Syria concluded defence pacts in May 1968 and July 1969.

Its Defence Commission is responsible for defence and security co-operation, and the defence of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of its members. There is a regional defence pact between France, Congo (Brazzaville), the Central African Republic and Chad, and there is a five-party defence agreement between France, Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger and Upper Volta which has set up the ‘Conseil de défense de l’Afrique équatoriale’."

    "text": "5.2 Bilateral Agreements\nA number of external powers have military arrangements with countries in the region. The United States has varying types of security assistance agreements and provides significant military aid on either a grant or credit basis to Ethiopia, Liberia and Congo (Kinshasa). For grant military assist- ance purposes, Ethiopia, where the United States has a large communications centre, is considered a base rights country. The Soviet Union and China are not known to have defence agreements with countries in the region but Soviet military assistance has been given to Guinea, Mali and Mauritania. Britain maintains defence agreements with Kenya and Mauritius, and an agreement with South Africa, made in June 1955 and revised in January 1967, covering the use of the Simonstown naval base. France has defence agreements with Cameroun, Gabon, Malagasy Republic, Mauritania, Senegal and Togo; technical military assistance agreements with Cameroun, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo (Brazzaville), Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Malagasy Republic, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Upper Volta; and mutual facilities agreements with Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger.t"

    "section": "6.1 CHINA",
    "text": "6.1 CHINA\nChina’s dominant strategic concept is People’s War, in which most of the population is allotted a military role. This entails a peacetime programme of rudimentary military training for civilians. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is heavily involved in the political and military administration of the country. China’s large manpower pool allows great selectivity in manning the 2.9 million strong regular forces. The vast bulk of the manpower lies in the land forces, specifically in the infantry and artillery. Out of a total of 140 divisions, only 5 are armoured. The Navy and Air Force account for little more than 10 per cent of the personnel, compared with about 30 per cent in the Soviet Union. The PLA is not equipped on the scale of major industrial countries, including the Soviet Union, and its mobility is limited. However, China’s military production is improving steadily in quantity and quality. She now produces the Tu-16 medium bomber, the MiG-21, the T-59 medium tank, the (Chinese) T-62 light tank, and APC, which improve the mobility of the PLA; also a new Chinese twin-engined fighter is being developed. In the Navy, the build-up of fast guided-missile patrol boats is continuing, along with its own version of the R-class medium range diesel-powered submarine. At least one nuclear-powered submarine appears to be under construction; it is probably an attack vessel. The PLA is organized in 11 Military Regions, and to some extent its equipment and logistics support reflect this regional character. Its deployment is uneven, with major concentrations along the littoral, the Canton-Wuhan railway and in the north-east. During 1969-70, there were some shifts of forces from the south of China to the northern half of the country, but little movement has been reported since. In July 1971 there were thought to be 15,000-20,000 railway engineers, con- struction engineers and protecting troops in North Vietnam and Laos. China has a 30-year Treaty of Alliance and Friendship with the Soviet Union signed in 1950 with mutual defence obligations, the validity of which must be in doubt. China has a mutual defence agreement with North Korea dating from 1961, and it is probable that she has well-defined defence commitments towards North Vietnam. China has in the past year continued to provide military assistance to Pakistan and Tanzania and to Albania with whom she has been co-operating on defence matters.\n\n6.1.1 Nuclear weapons programme\nChina conducted only one nuclear test in the past year, the eleventh since 1964. As with at least three of the previous tests, the 1970 explosion involved a fusion (thermonuclear) device with a yield of some 3 megatons. China has significant resources of natural uranium and its own plant for uranium enrichment. It may now have sufficient fissionable material for a total of about 120 fission and fusion weapons, although the availability of deuterium and/or tritium may constrain produc- tion of fusion weapons. For air delivery of nuclear weapons China had until recently only a few old Tu-4 bombers. At least 30 Tu-16, a medium bomber with an operational range of about 1,500 miles, have now been produced, and estimated production capacity is some 5 a month. China, which has been testing MRBM since the mid-1960s, has apparently deployed, mainly in north-western and north-eastern China, about 20 operational missiles with a range of up to 1,000 miles.* During 1970-71, a new missile testing site was also brought into use in Manchuria, The 230-kilogramme second earth satellite was launched, in March 1971, by a booster of IRBM capability. 41 allowing ballistic flights of up to 2,000 miles into the Sinkiang desert. One test from this site in late 1970 may have been connected with the development of an IRBM, or components for an ICBM. Full-range testing of an ICBM would require the use of impact areas and tracking facilities in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. There is no clear evidence to show what ‘mix’ of missile forces China is seeking to develop. The design of any Chinese ICBM would have to take into account the fact that the urban areas on the north-western coast of the United States are some 6,000 miles from Chinese territory. The responsibility for operational Chinese missile forces is believed to have been assigned to the ‘Second Artillery Command’. It is not clear whether this Command is autonomous (cf. the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces) or is subordinate to the Army."

    "text": "6.2 CHINA\nPopulation: 760,000,000.\nDEPLOYMENT: China is now divided into 11 Military Regions (MR), as Inner Mongolia has been incorporated in the Peking MR, and Tibet in the Chengtu MR. The military commander of each Region commands the regular air and naval forces assigned to it, and the civilian militia. The MR are in turn divided into Military Districts (MD), with usually two or three Districts to a Region. It is believed that basically one Army is assigned to each MD giving a total of about 30 Armies. An Army generally consists of three infantry divisions, three artillery regiments and, in some cases, three armoured regiments. Of the five armoured divisions in the PLA, two or three are probably kept in the Peking and Shenyang Regions. The geographical distribution of the divisions (excluding artillery) is believed to be: North and northeast China (Shenyang and Peking MR): 33 divisions. East and southeast China (Tsinan, Nanking and Foochow MR): 25 divisions. South-central China (Canton|| and Wuhan MR): 31 divisions. Midwest China (Lanchow MR): 11 divisions. West and southwest China (Sinkiang, Chengtu and Kunming MR): 20 divisions. North Vietnam and Laos: 1 railway engineer division and some construction engineer troops, in all 15-20,000 men. The army is, however, adequately equipped with infantry weapons, mortars, rocket-launchers, recoilless rifles and light and medium artillery, all produced in China. § There are, in addition, two or three divisions of border troops in each of these MR. II Includes Hainan island.\n\n6.2.1 Navy: 150,000 (including Naval Air Force and 28,000 Marines).\n1 submarine, G-class (with ballistic missile tubes). 32 fleet submarines. t 3 coastal submarines. 4 destroyers. 4 destroyer escorts. 11 patrol escorts. 24 submarine chasers. 15 missile patrol boats. 30 minesweepers. 45 auxiliary minesweepers. 220 MTB and hydrofoils (less than 100 tons). 320 motor gunboats Many less than 530 landing ships/landing craft 100 tons.\nDEPLOYMENT: North Sea Fleet: 240 vessels. The main bases are at Tsingtao and Lushun. It is deployed along the coast from the mouth of the Yalu river in the north to Lienyunkang in the south. East Sea Fleet: 700 vessels. Bases are at Shanghai and Chou Shan. It is deployed along the coast from Lienyunkang in the north to Chaoan Wan in the south. South Sea Fleet: 300 vessels. Bases are at Huangpu and Chanchiang. It is deployed from Chaoan Wan in the north to the North Vietnamese frontier in the south. China is not known to have any missiles for this boat. t Also about 10 older, training vessels. NAVAL AIR FORCE: 16,000; about 450 shore-based combat aircraft, including up to 100 Il-28 torpedo-carrying light bombers and substantial numbers of MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters: Though under Navy command, the fighters are fully integrated into the air defence system.\n\n\n6.2.2 Air Force: 180,000 (incl 85,000 air-defence person- nel); about 2,800 combat aircraft.\nAbout 30 Tu-16 and a few Tu-4 medium bombers. 150 Il-28 light bombers. About 1,700 MiG-15 and MiG-17; up to 800 MiG-19 and a growing number of MiG-21 fighters. Some An-2, II-14 and II-18 transports and Mi-4 helicopters (these could be supplemented by about 350 aircraft of the Civil Air Bureau). There is an air-defence system, initially developed to defend the eastern seaboard of China and now greatly expanded, based on early warning/con- trol radar, interceptor aircraft and some SA-2 SAM.\n\n\n6.2.3 Para-Military Forces:\nAbout 300,000 security and border troops, includ- ing 19 infantry-type divisions and 30 independent regiments stationed in the frontier areas; the public security force and a civilian militia with an effective element of probably not more than 5 million; production and construction corps in a number of MR, including those adjoining the northern frontier."

    "text": "6.3 OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES AND AUSTRALASIA\n\n6.3.1 Multilateral Agreements\nIn 1954 the United States, Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand signed the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, which came into force in 1955 and brought into being SEATO. They committed themselves to consult with a view to joint defence in the event of direct or indirect aggression against a member country or against the so-called ‘protocol states’ of Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam. However, since 1955 and 1956 respectively, Cambodia and Laos have not accepted the protection of SEATO. The treaty area is the general area of South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific, below latitude 21° 30’ North. SEATO has no central command structure and forces remain under national control. In 1969 Britain ceased to declare ground forces to the contingency plans for the Organization and France has no forces declared. Pakistan has announced her progressive disengagement from the Alliance. All remain members. The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand have troops serving in South Vietnam. This intervention was not the result of a decision by the SEATO Council, but these countries have, for the most part, justified this action in terms of their SEATO obligations. Australia, New Zealand and the United States are the members of a tripartite treaty known as ANZUS, which was signed in 1951 and is of indefinite duration. Under this treaty each agrees to ‘act to meet the common danger’ in the event of armed attack on either metropolitan or island territory of any one of them, or on armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific. Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Britain have agreed Five-Power defence arrangements relating to the external defence of Malaysia and Singapore, which will come into effect on 1 November 1971. Britain, Australia and New Zealand maintain forces in Malaysia and Singapore, with the land and naval components based in Singapore and Australia’s air contri- bution mainly at Butterworth in the Malayan Peninsula. Until 1 November 1971, the British commitment is governed by the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement but this is to be replaced after that date by new Five-Power political arrangements. These arrangements envisage that in the event of any armed attack or threat of attack externally organized or supported against Malaysia or Singapore, the five governments would consult together for the purpose of deciding what measures should be taken, jointly or separately."

    "text": "6.4 Bilateral Agreements\nThe United States has bilateral defence treaties with Japan,* the Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. It has a number of military arrangements with other countries of the region. It provides significant military aid on either a grant or credit basis to the Republic of China, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand and South Vietnam. It sells military equipment to many countries, notably Australia, the Republic of China and Japan. For grant military assistance purposes, Cambodia, the Republic of Korea and the Republic of China are considered forward defence areas. Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and South Vietnam receive grant military assistance direct from the US Department of Defense budget, the only countries in the world to do so. There are military facilities agreements with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. Major bases maintained in the region include Okinawa and Guam. The Soviet Union has treaties of friendship, co-operation and mutual assistance with Mongolia and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The validity of a similar treaty with the People’s * Either party may terminate the treaty by giving 1 year’s notice to the other. 44 Republic of China must be in doubt. Military assistance agreements with Ceylon and the People’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam reportedly exist. Important Soviet military aid is also given to Afghanistan and India and, on a small scale, to Pakistan.* China has non-aggression treaties with Burma, Afghanistan, and Cambodia, a treaty of friend- ship, co-operation and mutual assistance with North Korea; and a treaty of friendship with North Vietnam, which is thought to contain defence arrangements."

I Launched only from the surface. k Possibly small propellant. I Long-range bomber=maximum range over 6,000 miles; medium-range bomber=maximum range 3,500- 6,000 miles, primarily designed for bombing missions. m Theoretical maximum range, with internal fuel only, at optimum altitude and speed. Ranges for strike air- craft assume no weapon load. Especially in the case of strike aircraft, therefore, range falls sharply for flights at lower altitude, at higher speed or with full weapons load (e.g. combat radius of A-7, at operational height and speed, with typical weapons load, is approximately 620 miles). 12 Mach 1 (M=1.0)=speed of sound. o ASM=air-to-surface missile. P F-104 are no longer in active service as strike aircraft with the US Air Force but remain in service with other NATO air forces. a Names of Soviet aircraft (e.g. Bear) are of NATO origin. r Naval Air Force versions of the Tu-16 carry 2x Kelt or 2x Kennel ASM for anti-shipping use. 60 ## 3.
